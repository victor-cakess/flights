    "This script implements an end-to-end data transformation and consolidation pipeline for flight data stored in CSV files. It addresses issues such as inconsistent data types, duplicate rows, and formatting irregularities, ultimately unifying the data into a single, reliable table in a DuckDB database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What it does\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Setup & CSV Import:**  \n",
    "  Connects to (or creates) a DuckDB database file and imports CSV files from the \"helium\" folder. Each CSV file is converted into a table with its name derived from the filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Consolidation:**  \n",
    "  Merges individual CSV tables into a single \"flights\" table using a UNION ALL query, making the dataset easier to query and analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deduplication & Data Cleaning:**  \n",
    "  Identifies and removes duplicate rows to ensure data integrity. It also cleans string columns by removing extraneous characters and standardizing empty values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Schema Transformation:**  \n",
    "  Updates the schema by converting certain columns to appropriate data types (e.g., from VARCHAR to INT) and dropping unnecessary columns. This step standardizes the structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why it does it\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency:**  \n",
    "  The script handles inconsistencies in the data by enforcing uniform data types and standardized formatting, which is essential for reliable analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency:**  \n",
    "  Automating the import, cleaning, and consolidation processes reduces the need for manual intervention and minimizes the risk of human error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Integrity:**  \n",
    "  Deduplication and careful data cleaning ensure that the final consolidated dataset is accurate and ready for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability:**  \n",
    "  By merging multiple CSV sources into one unified table, the pipeline simplifies data management and makes the dataset easier to query at scale.\n"

    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This script creates, if it doesn't exist, a DuckDB database file named \"flight_data.duckdb\" and automatically imports all CSV files from the \"helium\" folder. Each CSV file is turned into a table in the database, with the table name derived from the CSV filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What it does\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database connection:**  \n",
    "  Connects to the DuckDB database file, creating it if necessary, so you don't have to worry about setting up the database manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CSV file discovery:**  \n",
    "  Uses glob to find all CSV files in the \"helium\" folder, ensuring every file is on deck for import.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Table creation:**  \n",
    "  For each CSV file, it:\n",
    "  - Extracts the filename (without the extension) to use as the table name.\n",
    "  - Reads the CSV file with `read_csv_auto`, forcing all values to be treated as strings.\n",
    "  - Creates a new table in DuckDB based on the CSV content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Progress Feedback:**  \n",
    "  Prints a confirmation message for each table created, so you're never left in the dark about what's been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cleanup:**  \n",
    "  Closes the database connection once all files have been imported, keeping everything neat and tidy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why it does it\n",
    "\n",
    "Because manually importing CSV files into a database is for those who enjoy unnecessary hassle. This script automates the import process, ensuring your flight data is consistently and reliably loaded into DuckDB, freeing you up to focus on listening to Alisson Becker's chant over and over again because he saved Liverpool against PSG, let's be honest.\n"
